# hass-config
-----------

This is the configuration for my local [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) install. It contains various stuff, previously I used [pyscript](https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/) extensively however in recent months I've pivoted to builtin automations and helpers for the most part.
